                        <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>
						<strong>Story</strong></br>
						At the outset of Darkest Dungeon, the player learns that they have inherited an estate from a relative who, while seeking fame 
						and fortune by excavating the dungeons and caracombs beneath their manor, has unearhed portals to dark dimensions and released 
						a number of horrific and evil creatures onto the world. Cowardly, the relative took his own life rather than dealing with his mistake. 
						As the current owner of the estate and the sorrounding lands, the player must recruit a roster of adventurers and mount expeditions to 
						cleanse the estate of its vile inhabitants
						</p>
						
						<p>
						As the player ventures into the manor, the dungeons below it, and the srrounding lands, they find their relative's memoirs telling of 
						the terrible deeds he had done in pursuit of knowledge and power. Eventually, the player is able to send a party into the titulat Darkest 
						Dungeon, the source of the land's corruption, taking steps to reveal its ultimate form. Within the deepest chamber, the player encounters 
						the disembodied spirit of their ancestor, who now remains as <i>Avatar of the Crawling Chaos</i>. After defeating the ancestor's apparition, 
						the party battles the Heart of Darkness - revealed to be the progenitor of all life on the planet. 
						The party manages to defeat its physical form at great cost, but the ancestor's spirit reveals to the player that this has only delayed its 
						inevitable awakening and, by extension, the end of the world. The ancestor explains that this is merely part of an endless cycle in the 
						player's lineage, and that the player will eventually meet the same fate as he, and their descendants onward. The ancestor then accentuates 
						this cycle by repeating his first words from the start of the game: <i>Ruin has come to our family</i>.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<strong>Gameplay</strong></br>
						Darkest Dungeon is a role-playing game in which the player manages a roster of heroes and adventurers to explore these dungeons and fight 
						the creatures within. Prior to entering a dungeon, the player can use facilities in a town near the mansion to dismiss or recruit more heroes, 
						send heroes to perform various activities that will heal them, gain new combat or camping skills, reduce their stress, or remove any afflictions 
						that they incurred while in a dungeon, and buy and sell equipment and supplies to outfit their heroes, using money and loot gained during dungeon 
						runs. Many of these facilities can also be improved to add more benefits or options to the player. The player can recruit up to twenty-five heroes 
						on their roster at any time; each hero belongs to one of fifteen character classes, and has their own statistics and skills that can be upgraded 
						over time. If a hero dies while exploring a dungeon, that hero is lost for good.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Surrounding the Hamlet and the facilities that the player uses are four different areas that must be cleared before the Darkest Dungeon can be accessed. 
						They are: The Ruins, the ancient tombs and hallways of the player's ancestors, now crawling with skeletons and mad cultists, and host to a Necromancer 
						and a mad prophet that are both there due to the Ancestor's machinations, the Weald, the overgrown forest that surrounds the hamlet, now home to slime 
						monsters, witches, bandits and mad dogs, the Cove, the murky caves beneath the cliff that the manor sits on, inhabited by fish-men and bandits, along 
						with a Siren and a ghostly Pirate crew, and the Warrens, the sewers of the manor, filled with offal and swarmed with pig-men that are the misguided product 
						of the Ancestor's first attempts at necromancy. Finally there is the Darkest Dungeon itself, within the manor, where the final boss resides.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Once the player has completed preparations, they select four of their heroes to go explore a dungeon. Access to most dungeons requires completing 
						several previous dungeons and collecting specific types of loot, with such later dungeons being more difficult than the earlier ones. Dungeons are 
						procedurally-generated in a roguelike manner, and presented as a series of interconnected rooms with hallways between each. The parties move between 
						rooms in a real-time, side-scrolling view, with the potential to discover interesting objects to search or random combat encounters during this time. 
						When the party reaches a room, they may be forced into combat, but once clear the room remains a safe zone allowing the player to apply healing and 
						other remedies to the party. When combat occurs, it plays out in a turn-based manner, with each character having their own order based on initiative 
						that changes each turn. Heroes can use attacks, magic, special skills, or items during their turn to defeat the other party. The order which the party 
						moves through the passages and rooms is critical as it affects who may interact with various items, and the available actions that a character can do 
						while in combat; for example, a swordsman in the back of the party cannot easily attack, while range-attack characters like archers and mages can. The 
						positions of heroes can be changed around, but this can consume time or a combat turn. While each dungeon has a target goal, the player can opt to 
						leave the dungeon at any time, retaining all loot collected but forgoing the larger reward for clearing out the dungeon.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						A core element of Darkest Dungeon is its Affliction system, a concept of a hero's stress level or resolve. Though a hero will have little stress when 
						they are hired, it will worsen from a number of factors encountered while in a dungeon, such as adventuring without food or light sources, seeing the 
						death or wounding of a fellow party member in battle, or from blights cast on them by enemies. If the hero's high stress remains unchecked, they may 
						develop afflictions that will interfere with the behavior of the character, such as being frightened and unable to fight directly. Less frequently, a 
						stressed character may develop virtues that enhance their attributes, such as becoming more invigorated within battle. Some afflictions, left unchecked, 
						may become permanent quirks that remain on the character. Other afflictions can be removed back in the village and by performing special activities, 
						such as drinking at a bar or repenting at a church, that occupy the character's time, preventing them from being part of a dungeon party. Stress can be 
						lowered while in a dungeon through camping offered at specific locations, or other restorative items, as well as when back in the nearby town. 
						While camping, the characters will have another set of available skills that can be used to help relieve stress and help with other party members.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						In addition to downloadable content, Red Hook has announced plans to add two new game modes to Darkest Dungeon. The first, Radiant mode, is aimed to 
						reduce the length of time to complete the game's campaign, from an average 80 hours to around 40 hours, without compromising the core difficulty with 
						the game. This was to address complaints from players that one or two ill-fated dungeon runs late in the game that can wipe out a party can stall any 
						progress towards completion. The second mode is a New Game Plus, which players can take their characters from a completed game to face more difficult 
						dungeons while replaying through the game's story.
