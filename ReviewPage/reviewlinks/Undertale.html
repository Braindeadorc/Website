                        <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>
						<strong>Story</strong></br> 
						Undertale takes place in the Underground, a realm where monsters, once equal to humans, were banished to after war broke out between them. 
						The Underground is sealed from the surface world by an imperfect magic barrier, the only point of entry being at Mount Ebott. 
						A human child falls into the Underground and encounters Flowey, a sentient flower who teaches them the game's mechanics and encourages 
						them to raise their "LV", or "LOVE", by gaining "EXP" through killing monsters. When Flowey attempts to murder the human to take their soul 
						for himself, the human is rescued by Toriel, a motherly goat-like monster, who teaches the human to solve puzzles and survive conflict in the 
						Underground without killing. She intends to adopt the human, wanting to protect them from Asgore Dreemurr, the king of the Underground.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						The human eventually leaves Toriel to search for Asgore's castle, which contains the barrier leading to the surface world. Along the way, 
						the human encounters several monsters, including: the skeletons Sans and Papyrus, two brothers who act as sentries for the Underground; 
						Undyne, the head of the royal guard; Alphys, the kingdom's royal scientist; and Mettaton, a robotic television host Alphys created. 
						Some of them are fought, with the human having to choose whether to kill them or to show mercy; should the human spare them, they become friends. 
						During their travels, the human learns the cause of the war between humans and monsters. The human also learns the backstory of Asriel, 
						the son of Asgore and Toriel. Asriel had befriended a human child named Chara who fell into the Underground and was adopted by Asgore and Toriel. 
						One day, Chara was fatally poisoned by some flowers. Asriel absorbed Chara's soul, which allowed him to cross through the barrier. 
						When Asriel returned Chara's body to the humans, they attacked and killed him. It is later revealed that Chara committed suicide and had planned 
						to take control of Asriel's body and powers to destroy humans; however, once above ground, Asriel resisted Chara's control and allowed himself to 
						be killed. Asgore now seeks to break the barrier, which requires him to collect seven human souls, of which he has six.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						The game's ending depends on how the player resolved encounters with monsters. In the default scenario, if the player killed some but not all 
						monsters, the Neutral Route occurs. The human arrives at Asgore's castle and learns that they also need a monster's soul to cross the barrier, 
						forcing them to fight Asgore. Sans stops the human before their confrontation, revealing that the human's "LOVE" is an acronym for 
						"Level Of ViolencE" and "EXP" for "EXecution Points." Sans judges the human based on the combined resolution of the encounters. The human fights 
						Asgore, but Flowey interrupts them, killing Asgore and stealing the human souls, becoming a monstrous abomination. With the aid of the rebelling 
						souls, the human defeats Flowey, falls unconscious, and awakens on the human side of the barrier; they receive a phone call from Sans, explaining 
						the state of the Underground after the human's departure.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						If the player kills no monsters, befriends Papyrus and Undyne and has completed a previous Neutral playthrough of the game, the player gains access 
						to the Pacifist Route, returning the player to immediately before they fight Asgore. Undyne tasks the player with bringing a letter to Alphys, and 
						along the way the player discovers more about Asriel's backstory, as well as the nature of human Determination. Flowey is revealed to be a reincarnation 
						of Asriel, accidentally created as part of Alphys's experiments with the power of determination. After befriending Alphys and completing this sidequest, 
						the player returns to fight Asgore as they did in the Neutral Route. Toriel intervenes before the human fights Asgore, and is joined by the other monsters 
						the human has befriended. Flowey ambushes the group, using the souls of all the monsters to take an older Asriel's form to fight the human. 
						The human connects with their new friends during the fight, eventually triumphing. Asriel reverts to his child form, destroys the barrier, and expresses 
						his remorse to the others before leaving. The human falls unconscious, and is awoken to see their friends surrounding them, with the knowledge of the 
						human's name - Frisk. The monsters reintegrate with the humans on the surface, while Frisk has the option of accepting Toriel as their adoptive mother.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Another ending ensues if the player kills all monsters, known as the 'Genocide' or 'No Mercy' route. In this route, Frisk becomes influenced by Chara's 
						now-malevolent spirit, who assumes control over the course of the player's journey. When Frisk reaches Asgore's castle, Sans attempts to stop them, 
						but Frisk kills him along with Asgore and Flowey. Chara materializes after Flowey is killed and explains that the player's determination made them whole 
						again. Chara then asks the player to join them in the destruction of the universe, which occurs regardless of the player's choice. 
						In order to enable further replays of the game, Frisk must first give their soul to Chara in exchange for restoring the universe. In doing so, 
						every future playthrough becomes marred by Chara's presence, with the endings of each pacifist run afterwards firmly implying that Chara intends to 
						wreak havoc upon the player and their friends.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<strong>Gameplay</strong></br>
						Undertale is a role-playing game that uses a top-down perspective. In the game, players control a child and complete objectives in order to progress 
						through the story. Players explore an underground world of towns and caves, and are required to solve numerous puzzles on their journey. 
						The underground world is the home of monsters, many of whom challenge the player in combat; players decide to kill, flee, or befriend them.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						When players encounter enemies in either scripted events or random encounters, they enter a battle mode. During battles, players control a 
						small red heart which represents their soul, and must avoid attacks unleashed by the opposing monster in a similar fashion to a bullet hell shooter.
						As the game progresses, new elements are introduced, such as colored obstacles which require players to remain stationary or move through them, 
						and boss battles which change the way players control the heart. Players may choose to attack the enemy, which involves timed button presses, 
						earning EXP and gold for defeating them. Alternatively, they can use the ACT option to perform non-violent actions, which vary depending on the enemy. 
						If players uses the right actions to respond to the enemy, they can choose to spare them and end the fight without killing them. 
						In order for some boss encounters to be completed peacefully, the player is required to survive until the character they are facing has finished 
						their dialogue. The game features various story branches and endings depending on whether players choose to kill or spare their enemies; and as such, 
						it is possible to clear the game without killing a single enemy.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Monsters will converse with players during the battles, and the game will tell the players what the monster's feelings and actions are. 
						Enemy attacks alter based on how players interact with them: should players choose non-violent options, enemy attacks are easy, whereas they 
						become difficult if players choose violent options. The game relies on a number of metafictional elements in both its gameplay and story. 
						When players participate in a boss battle on a second playthrough, the dialogue will be altered depending on actions in previous playthroughs.

                            <p>
							Played the game 3 times now, my first playthrough was the genocide run and how that ending made me want to play it again 
							just to change the ending, my second playthrough though, was a pacifist run and it was tear-jerking at the least of it. 
							</p>
							
							<p>
							My last playtrough, I was trying to do a neutral run, but after falling in love with the characters in my pacifist run, 
							I just can't kill any of the monsters, I ended up doing a paficist run on my last playthrough. the game has a unique game 
							game mechanic that can let you spare the enemy that you are fighting rather than killing them.
