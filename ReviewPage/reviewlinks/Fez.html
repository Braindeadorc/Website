                        <p>
						<strong>Story</strong></br>
						<h6>-Fan Made Game Lore-</h6>
						Before time was recorded, there were the Owls, who created the pyramid as seen in the "End Level" of the game, 
						which is the home planet to the "Visitors" or "Aliens" that visited the Zu on their home planet.The Zu had established 
						a way of life similar to earth. This plane, not yet named, had other creatures, which the Zu hunted, cooked and ate. 
						The Zu have abandoned all but one settlement, leaving the others in ruins. It is unknown what happened to the Zu that 
						caused them to abandon their other settlements.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						It is said on one fateful day, the Zu encountered the Visitors, an unknown alien race. The king of the Visitors gave them 
						the ability to see their world in 3D. With this power there became a monarchy within the Zu where only the king and his 
						trusted advisers could see in the 3rd dimension. The king wore a crown, while his advisers wore a fez. What little is known 
						about the Villagers and Gomez is that they are descendant of the Zu, most likely a forgotten colony of the Zu who have advanced 
						in technology and language. Even though they are ancient, the Zu have advanced further than the Villagers, in one case, the 
						atmosphere and architecture similar to that of a 1920's city. The Zu speak in their own language consisting of the Zu Alphabet, 
						Which reads Top-Bottom, Right-Left. The most that is known about the Zu and the Hexahedron is that the Zu's ruins contain methods 
						of reclaiming the lost Cubes and cube shards. The remaining Zu in their sky village still speak their native language, which must 
						be deciphered in order to read it, what is known about the surviving Zu is that they are rebuilding the Portal to the other realms/worlds, 
						and they have no idea what has become of their brethren.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<strong>Gameplay</strong></br>
						Fez is a two-dimensional (2D) puzzle platform game set in a three-dimensional (3D) world. The player-character Gomez lives peacefully on 
						a 2D plane until he receives a red fez and witnesses the breakup of a giant, golden hexahedron that tears the fabric of spacetime and reveals 
						a third dimension. After the game appears to glitch, reset, and reboot, the player can rotate between four 2D views of the 3D world, as 
						four sides around a cube-like space. This rotation mechanic reveals new paths through the levels by connecting otherwise inaccessible 
						platforms, and is the basis of Fez's puzzles. For example, floating platforms become a solid road, discontinuous ladders become whole, and 
						platforms that move along a track stay on course. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments, which accrete to restore 
						order to the universe. In search of these cubes, Gomez traverses the game environment by jumping between ledges. Other platforming 
						elements change with the level themes, including crates that activate switches, bombs that reveal passages, and pistons that launch Gomez airborne.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						The exploratory parts of the game feature a series of arcane codes and glyphs, treasure maps and chests, and secret rooms. Players are left 
						without guidance to determine whether game elements are decipherable subpuzzles or simply false signals. These sorts of puzzles include hidden 
						warp gates, enigmatic obelisks, invisible platforms, sequences of tetrominos, a ciphered alphabet, and QR codes. One of the game's 
						recurring themes is an ancient civilization that attempted to make sense of their dimensionality, as told through artifacts.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Fez has no enemies, bosses, or punishments for failure the player-character quickly respawns upon falling to his death. The game's 
						designer described Fez as a "'stop and smell the flowers' kind of game". It prioritizes puzzle-solving and patience over the platforming 
						genre's traditional interest in dexterity. Fez features a pixelated art style and a limited color palette reminiscent of the 8-bit 
						era. Its homage includes Tetris tetrominos inscribed on the walls and in the sky, The Legend of Zelda treasure chest animations, 
						Super Mario Bros. mushroom levels, travel by pipe, and floating platforms. The game's settings include forests, factories, a coastal 
						lighthouse, an urban city, and a library. Fez's New Game Plus mode adds a first-person perspective feature and lets the player revisit 
						areas to collect "anti-cubes" from harder puzzles. This second half of the game is more challenging and focuses on code cracking.
