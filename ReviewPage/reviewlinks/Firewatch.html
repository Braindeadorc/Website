                        <h4>Firewatch</h4>
                        <p>
						<strong>Story</strong></br> 
						In 1989, following the Yellowstone fires of 1988, Henry (Rich Sommer) takes a job as a Shoshone National Forest fire lookout, 
						after his wife Julia (Larissa Gallagher) develops early-onset dementia. On the first day, his supervisor Delilah (Cissy Jones) 
						contacts him via walkie-talkie and asks that he investigate illegal fireworks at a nearby lake. There he detects teenage girls 
						skinny dipping, who accuse him of leering. On his way back, he finds a locked cave and spots a shrouded figure. Henry discovers 
						his watchtower ransacked at arrival. The next day, Delilah sends him to a downed communication line. It is found cut, along with 
						a message from the girls. He and Delilah plot to scare them off, but Henry finds their campsite abandoned.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Henry finds a backpack and disposable camera belonging to a boy named Brian Goodwin, who Delilah explains was the son of Ned 
						(Mac Brandt), a fellow lookout. Brian had illicitly stayed with his father, though Delilah had kept this from her superiors, 
						and both Brian and Ned had disappeared without a trace. The teenage girls are reported missing. Henry later discovers a radio and 
						clipboard with transcripts of his conversations with Delilah. He is knocked out and finds the clipboard and radio gone. Henry 
						proceeds to break into a government research area, discovering surveillance equipment and typewritten reports detailing his and 
						Delilah's lives and conversations. After taking a tracking device, he leaves the compound. As Henry hikes back, he witnesses it set 
						afire by an unknown individual. Using the tracking device, Henry finds a backpack with the keys to the cave. Delilah reports someone 
						in Henry's tower. Henry finds a Walkman with incriminating conversations of him and Delilah plotting to destroy the compound.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Henry enters the cave and is locked in. He escapes through another exit, and discovers a place used by Brian to escape his father. 
						Henry goes deeper into the cave with the climbing equipment left at Brian's camp, and discovers Brian's corpse at the bottom of a 
						cavern, piled under rocks. Delilah is upset, blaming herself for allowing Brian to stay. The next day, a conflagration grows 
						uncontrollably and an emergency evacuation order is given out to all lookouts. As Henry prepares, he follows the tracking device's 
						signal to a cassette tape from Ned, who claims that Brian's death was because of climbing inexperience. Unwilling to return to society, 
						Ned admits to living in the wilderness and is trekking deeper, advising against following him. Henry finds Ned's camp with items from the 
						watchtowers, camp and teenage girls, whom Delilah confirms are safe and sound. The government camp was studying wildlife, with Ned using 
						radio equipment to deter Henry. Delilah states that a rescue helicopter is waiting for him at Thorofare Lookout and he treks there to find 
						Delilah gone, having taken another helicopter. Using the radio equipment, he contacts her one final time and asks when he will see her again. 
						She tells him to go back to his wife and Henry boards a helicopter heading home.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<strong>Gameplay</strong></br>
						Firewatch is a first-person adventure game that takes place in the American state of Wyoming in 1989. Players take on the role of Henry, 
						a fire lookout who is assigned to his own tower in Shoshone National Forest.[3] Through exploration of the surrounding area, Henry uncovers clues 
						about mysterious occurrences in the vicinity that are related to the ransacking of his tower while out on a routine patrol and a shadowy figure 
						that occasionally appears watching him from afar.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Henry's only means of communication is a walkie-talkie connecting him to his supervisor, Delilah. Players may choose from a number of dialog 
						options to speak with her upon the discovery of new interactive objects or environments, or can refrain from communicating. The player's choices 
						will influence the tone of Henry's relationship with Delilah. As the story progresses, new areas will be opened up for players. The game also features 
						a day-night cycle. Objects found in the wilderness can be kept in the inventory for later use.
