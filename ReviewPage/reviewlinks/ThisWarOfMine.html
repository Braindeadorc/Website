						<strong>Story</strong></br> 
						Player Driven Story
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<strong>Gameplay</strong></br>
						This War of Mine is a survival-themed strategy game where the player controls a group of civilian survivors in a makeshift shelter in the besieged, 
						war-torn fictional city of Pogoren, Graznavia. The main goal of the game is to survive the war with the tools and materials the player can gather 
						with the characters they control. Most of the characters under the player's control have no military background or any kind of survival experience, 
						and will require constant intervention by the player in order to stay alive. It is the player's responsibility to maintain their characters' health, 
						hunger and mood levels until the declaration of a ceasefire, which occurs after a randomized duration.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						During the daytime, hostile snipers will prevent the survivors from venturing outside, thereby offering the player time to craft tools from gathered 
						materials, trade, upgrade the shelter, cook food and heal the survivors. At night, the player is given the opportunity to venture out and scavenge 
						nearby areas for valuable resources for their everyday survival. During their excursions, the player-controlled survivors can encounter other NPC 
						survivors of the war, who they can choose to help with gifts of food or medicine, or rob and kill. The player can also build a radio inside their 
						shelter, which will provide useful information such as weather warnings, updates on the city's economy and news of the ongoing war effort to help 
						the player plan appropriate shelter upgrades and scavenging missions.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						The player starts off with two, three or even four survivors whose actions the player can affect. The actions the player makes will change the type 
						of endings each survivor has. The game starts the player with Bruno, Pavle, and Marko or Katia on their first time through. Each character has one 
						or two traits that helps/hinders the player. Some traits are useful during certain days while others are useful all the time. For example, Bruno has a 
						trait called "Good Cook" which helps the player use less fuel and water when cooking meals. There are a total of 12 playable characters. 
						The Little Ones DLC includes the possibility of adding an extra, child survivor, that can not defend him/herself or perform any of the tasks needed 
						to maintain the shelter at first. In addition, the child survivor must be given constant attention to prevent it from being depressed, but can be 
						taught by the other survivors to perform small chores like cooking, filtering water or growing crops, and once bonding with an adult, it can sleep 
						with them in the same bed at night, dispensing the need of a separate bed for both.

							This war of mine takes you in a post-war apocalyptic scene where you have to gather materials for your shelter, 
							and you have to gather food for you to survive, the game is a 2D based game and it looks like a drawn 
							post wold war 1 painting. 
							</p>
							
							<p>
							The game, does not lack in gameplay as it makes you strategies and ration your food and situation each passing day 
							in the game, though the game does have an ending, it does make you want to play the game more and start a new game.
							</p>
