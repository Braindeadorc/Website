                        <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>
						<strong>Story</strong></br>
						The Binding of Isaac is loosely inspired by the biblical story of the same name. 
						Isaac, a child, and his mother live in a small house on a hill, both happily keeping the themselves, with Isaac drawing pictures and playing toys,
						and his mother watching Christian boradcasts on television. Isaac's mother then hears "a voice from above", stating her son is corrupted
						with sin, and needs to be saved. It asks her to remove all that evil from Isaac, in an attempt to save him. His mother obliges, taking 
						away his toys, drawings and even his clothes.
						</p>
						<p>
						the voice once again speaks to isaac's mother, stating that Isaac must be cut off from all that is evil in the world. Once again, his mother 
						obliges, and locks Isaac inside his room. Isaac, watching through a sizable crack in his door, starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor hidden 
						under his rug and jumps in.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>In Game Story</strong></br>
						During the game's loading points, Isaac is shown curled up in a ball, crying. His thoughts are visible, tanging among rejection from his mother 
						and humiliation from his peers to a scenario involving his own death. The game features 13 possible endings, one after each major boss fight.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<strong>Gameplay</strong></br>
						The Binding of Isaac is a top-down dungeon crawler game, presented using two-dimentional sprites, in which the player 
						controls Isaac or other unlockable characters as they explore the dungeons located in Isaac's basement. The characters 
						differ in speed. health, damage and other attributes. The game's mechanics and presentation is similar to dungeons of 
						<i>The Legend Of Zelda<i>, while incorporating random, procedurally-generated levels in the manner of a rouguelike game. 
						On each floor of the basement dungeon, the player must fight in a room before continueing onto the next room. This is most 
						commonly done by the character's tears as bullets in the style of a twin-stick shooter, but the player can also use a limited 
						supply of bombs to damage enemies and clear out paths of the room. Other motheds of defeating enemies become possible as the 
						character gains power-ups, items that are automatically worn by the player-character when picked up that can alter the character's 
						core attributes, such as increasing health or the strength of each tear, or cause additional effects, such as for allowing charged 
						tear shots to be fired after holding down a controller button or key for a short while, or a menas to fire tears character. Power-ups 
						include passive items that improve the character's attributes automatically, active power-ups that can be used once before ther are 
						recharged by completing additional rooms in the dungeon, and single-use power-ups such as pills or Tarot cards that confer a one-time 
						benefit when used, such as regaining full health, or increasing or decreasing all attributes of the character. the effect of power-ups stack 
						so that the player may come into highly-beneficial power-up combinations
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Once a room is cleared of monstersm it will remain clear, allowing the player to re-trace their way through the level, though once the move 
						onto the next level, the cannot return. Along the way, the player can collect money to buy power-ups from shopkeepers, keys to unlock special 
						treasure rooms, and new weapons and power-ups to strengthen their chances against the enemies. the playe'rs health is tracked by the number 
						number of hearts, if the character loses all their hearts, the game ends in permadeath and the player must start over from a freshly-generated 
						dungeon. Each floor of the dungeon includes a boss which the player must defeat before continuing to the eighth floor. An optional ninth floor, 
						Sheol contains the boss Satan. Winning the game with certain characters or by certain conditions unlocks new power-ups that might appear in the 
						dungeon or the ability to use one of the other characters. The game tracks the various power-ups that the player has found over time which can 
						be reviewed from the game's menu.
