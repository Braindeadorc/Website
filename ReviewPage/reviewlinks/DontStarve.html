						<strong>Story</strong></br>
						As the game itself opens with Maxwell snidely informing the player of their gaunt appearance and includes little further 
						story, the game's setup is told through its trailer. On a dark and stormy night, Wilson appears to be getting nowhere in 
						a chemistry experiment until he is startled by his radio speaking to him. It reveals that it has noticed his trouble and 
						has <i>secret knowledge</i> for him. When he eagerly agrees, a flurry of equations and diagrams encircle him and fill his head 
						with this information. Using white rats, a typewriter, and his own blood, among other tools and materials, Wilson creates a 
						giant machine. The radio commends his work and tells him to pull the machine's switch. He hesitates, but at the radio's 
						insistence, he does it; the machine rattles violently and a pair of ghostly arms whisk him into a different world while an 
						apparition of Maxwell cackles.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						As the player wakes up each morning during the Adventure mode, Maxwell appears over them and comments. At first he seems 
						impressed at the player's hardiness; he then becomes irritated and urges the player to turn back. He offers the player a truce 
						but then becomes completely enraged
						</p>
						
						<p>
						At the end of Adventure, the player reaches an island called Maxwell's Island with a hall belonging to Maxwell on it. The player 
						finds Maxwell trapped in a throne encircled by short stone pillars. The player is at first unable to free him, but finds a keyhole,
						as well as a key nearby. The player sets Maxwell free, but he turns into a skeleton and disintegrates as soon as he stands up. 
						The ghostly arms from the trailer then grab the player and ensnare them in the throne. An epilogue implies that the player will take 
						on a villainous role similar to Maxwell's using newfound powers given by the throne, but will nonetheless be trapped forever.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<strong>Gameplay</strong></br>
						Don't Starve is an action-adventure game with a randomly generated open world and elements of survival and roguelike gameplay. 
						Combat is handled by pointing and clicking with the mouse, while other activities are controlled by the keyboard, or using the 
						inbuilt gamepad support to play using a controller, giving it a console-like gameplay feel. The goal is to survive as long 
						as possible, with a count of the number of days the player has survived shown onscreen. The game keeps few records of player 
						progress besides the total number of experience points and the playable characters unlocked. Wilson is the main playable character, 
						but the first character, Willow, can be unlocked with 160 experience points-the player earns 20 each in-game day and receives them 
						after dying-while Woodie, the last, requires the game's limit of 1,600. As is common among roguelikes, death is permanent, 
						barring the use of several rare and difficult to acquire items, like the Meat Effigy, Touch Stone, and Life Giving Amulet.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						The game relies on a day/night cycle that causes meaningful fluctuations in gameplay style. During the day, the player spends 
						most of their time exploring the world; gathering food, firewood, and other items; discovering "recipes" to combine available 
						items; and avoiding enemies. With nightfall comes dangerous monsters as well as an invisible menace (Charlie) which attacks the 
						player when the screen is dark. A player must either have a nearby light source or must have some sort of night vision to prevent 
						the night monster from attacking. Crafting, which uses recipes, allows the player to create shelters and weapons like axes. 
						The characters are able to gather and farm plants as well as hunt animals for sustenance, with several characters having dietary 
						perks or restrictions. Food can spoil, however, so the player cannot keep it for too long. Eating spoiled food results in loss of 
						health, sanity, and an increase in hunger. Each in-game day takes 8 minutes of real time.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Death can occur in a variety of ways. The player has three gauges displayed on the game's heads-up display, which respectively track 
						hunger, health, and sanity. Hunger worsens by default, being replenished with food. Sanity decreases during the dusk and night, or 
						as a result of certain unpleasant actions, such as robbing graves or being in complete darkness; it can be replenished through mentally 
						stimulating activities, such as sleeping, picking flowers, and wearing "dapper" clothing. When hunger gets too low, it begins to chip 
						away at health, which will eventually result in the player's death. A large variety of creatures can attack the player, including giant 
						one-eyed birds, tree monsters, tentacles whose owners are not shown, and even small, weak frogs that will nonetheless try to accost the 
						player and steal from them. Additionally, at low enough sanity, figments of the character's imagination become corporeal and able to 
						attack the player. Some creatures, such as pig-like creatures often found in tribes, begin as neutral to the player 
						(Excluding the Reign of Giants character Webber), but the player's actions may lead them to be allies or hostile foes.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						The game's bulk occurs in Sandbox Mode, but there is a second mode, Adventure, which the player can access by finding a landmark called 
						"Maxwell's Door." Adventure serves as the game's campaign, and consists of five levels that pit the player against Maxwell, the antagonist 
						of Don't Starve. The player loses all items and recipes upon entering, and can only pick four to keep upon completion of each chapter. 
						Death or completion of all five chapters results in being returned intact to Sandbox Mode.
